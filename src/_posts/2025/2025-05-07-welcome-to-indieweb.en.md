After setting up an RSS feed reader and reading Hacker News for some time, I realized 
(again) how fantastic personal blogs are. So many interesting people and posts which never 
make it into my usual channels.

In the last few years I drifted completely to Mastodon and a few news sites. Probably because 
this was already too much, I stopped using RSS and also stopped reading personal blogs.

I want to change that again. Less news, more blogs. I looked for public blog lists, asked at 
Mastodon (and didn't got any answers), thought about blogrolls and even creating a project 
to index blogs.

While googling about all this, I stumbled upon [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/). I am writing 
blog posts for 15 years now, IndieWeb exists since 2010. But still, I never heard about it. 
Also not in the Hackerspace/CCC bubble.

## Principles

There is a [principles page](https://indieweb.org/principles), but these are my favorite ones:

### âœŠ Own your data

All content, metadata and even your identity is owned by you and maintained on your own 
domain. [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) also describes how to syndicate your content 
created on your website to the platforms your friends are using.

> **Stay in touch with friends now**, not some theoretical future.

Even if your hosting provider or CMS is changing, you keep control. And it's not hard to keep 
your stuff available. But if a social media company is changing directions or closes completely, 
your data is gone in the worst case.

### ðŸ’ªÂ Make what you need, ðŸ˜‹ and use it

Make stuff for yourself and not for some hypothetical user. Use the stuff you made actively. 
[POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) keeps you connected with your friends, so no need to 
convince someone to switch vom platform A to platform B.

## ðŸ““ Document your stuff

I do that already for a long time as it helps me to understand and remember things better. 
But it can also be of benefit for other users.

## ðŸ—¿ Longevity 

Make your online presence future proof. Use open formats to store documents and data, so it 
will outlast the next ten social network trends.

## ðŸŽ‰Â Above all, HaveÂ fun

Your web presence exists because it was fun to make it. Keep it that way.

## Meetups

There are [regular meetups and events](https://events.indieweb.org/). I hope I can visit the 
IndieWebCamp in Berlin in November. ðŸ¤žðŸ¤ž

## Distributed Social Platform

For me, this is the thing where I got hooked. The web standards 
[Webmention](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) and 
[microformats2](https://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2) enabling users to interact 
with each other though their websites.

For example, if I would like to send a like or a comment to another blog, I create a new post 
or note on my website with a [microformat reply](https://indieweb.org/reply) on it and send this 
URL as webmention to the destination post URL.

The receiving website then crawls my reply post and publishes the like or comment afterwards. 
It's up to the receiving site how this is happening. Fully automated or with a manual review 
process. More on that in a later post.

## POSSE

Publish (on your) own site, syndicate elsewhere.

Host all data created by yourself on your own website and publish it (automated) on other 
platforms to make it accessible for your friends and others. This is done by a mix of web 
services and web standards.  More on that in a later post.

*I think this will become a blog post series of at least three articles. Next part will 
describe how Webmention and Microformats work in detail. Don't miss it. ðŸš€*
