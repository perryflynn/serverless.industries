One of the first things I checked out after I [learned about the IndieWeb][indieweb] was
[webrings][webring]. Invented 1994, a webring chains websites together in a circular structure.
Next/Previous links are present on every member website to switch between them.

The webrings I implemented at the bottom of this page:

- [An IndieWeb webring](https://xn--sr8hvo.ws/)
- [UberBlogr](https://uberblogr.de/)

Once a website is registered, the webring software will generate HTML Code to embed. This has
to be added at least to the main page (`/`) of the website.

There is also a [random](https://xn--sr8hvo.ws/random) ([random](https://uberblogr.de/rand/serverless))
link to discover websites on the webring. 

I had a great time to check out new websites. ‚ù§
