A CI Pipeline project which builds portable versions of popular tools
like `curl`, `busybox` or `tcpdump`. It uses GitLab CI and Docker to
create self-contained and portable build jobs which can be reproducted
very easily on own infrastructure.

The builds can be found [on the files page](https://files.serverless.industries/bin/).
