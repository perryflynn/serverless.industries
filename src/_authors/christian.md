Hi! I am a software engineer with strong Infrastructure skills.

I've started with the classic LAMP stack about fifteen years ago,
switched in the meantime to Angular and .NET Core, then beginning of
2023 to a 100% infrastructure position.

Now I'm working with Ansible, Chef Infra, Terraform, Docker, Python, Linux and Proxmox.
