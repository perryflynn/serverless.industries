Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I am a software engineer with strong IT infrastructure skills.

I've started with the classic LAMP stack about twenty years ago,
switched in the meantime to Angular and .NET, then beginning of
2023 to a 100% infrastructure position.

Now I'm working with Ansible, Chef Infra, Terraform, AWS, Kubernetes, Python, Linux and Proxmox.

Still, from time to time, I have fun at writing code in .NET, PHP, Python and Bash.
